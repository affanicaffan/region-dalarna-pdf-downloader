## Features

### Core Functionality
- **URL Input**: Enter any Netpublicator URL to fetch available PDF files
- **Subfolder Scanning**: Search current folder only (depth 0) or include subfolders up to 5 levels deep
- **File Selection**: Choose which PDFs to download with checkboxes organized by folder
- **Smart Filtering**: Add/remove files based on filename text patterns
- **Bulk Actions**: Select all or deselect all files with one click

### Advanced Filtering
- **Folder Exclusion**: Skip folders containing specific words/phrases (e.g., "archive, old, 2022")
- **Date Range Filter**: Only include folders with dates within a specified range
- **Search Speed Control**: 
  - **Turbo** (0.3s delay) - Fast but higher risk of errors
  - **Normal** (0.7s delay) - Balanced approach (recommended)
  - **Slow** (2.0s delay) - Most reliable for slow connections

### User Interface
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Shows current folder location with clickable links
- **Folder Organization**: Files grouped by their folder location with visual hierarchy
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during scanning
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed information about folders that couldn't be scanned
- **Timing Information**: Shows total scan time and loading delays

## Search Configuration Guide

### Subfolder Depth
- **0**: Current folder only - fastest, most reliable
- **1**: Include direct subfolders 
- **2-5**: Include deeper subfolder levels (may take longer)

### Search Speed Settings
- **Turbo (0.3s)**: Fastest scanning, but may cause errors on slow connections
- **Normal (0.7s)**: Recommended balance of speed and reliability  
- **Slow (2.0s)**: Most reliable for unstable connections or heavy server load

### Folder Exclusion Examples
- `archive, old`: Skip folders containing "archive" or "old"
- `2022, 2021`: Skip folders from specific years
- `temp, backup`: Skip temporary or backup folders
